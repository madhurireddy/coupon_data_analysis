# coupon_data_analysis

The car column has significant missing values (99.15%), suggesting it may not be useful unless you specifically need it for analysis. Dropping this column might simplify the dataset.
The other columns (Bar, CoffeeHouse, CarryAway, RestaurantLessThan20, Restaurant20To50) have minimal missing values (< 2%), so filling them with "never" or "unknown" is a good approach.
